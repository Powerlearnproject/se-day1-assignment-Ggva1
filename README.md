Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
      
      software engineering involves designing, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products. Its importance is by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
      
      1. Development of programming languages and establishment os sowtware enhineering as a discpline in 1960s
      2. The advent of structured programming in 1970s
      3. Rise of agile methodologies in 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

      1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs
      2. Design: Creating high level and detailed designs of the software achitecture and user interface
      3. Implemantation: writing code and building the software according to specifications
      4. Testing: Conducting Various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
      5. Deployment : realising the software to users
      6. Maintenance: making enhancements to the software after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

     waterfall methodology involves sequential approach with disntict phases while Agile methodology involves iterative and incremental approach focusec  on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

    1. Responsible for writing codes and implemantating software solutions
    2. Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
    3. creates user interface and designs user experiences for software applications
    4. designs the overall structure and achitecture of software systems

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

         challenges
    changing requirements 
    tight deadlines
    technical debt 

         strategies to overcome
    agile methodologies
    priotazitions of tasks
    effective communications
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

     unit testing: testing individual components
     integration testing: testing interactions between different components 
     system testing: testing the entire system as a whole
     acceptance testing: testing the software against requirementsto ensure user needs are met
    
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

    promt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best response from AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

     "Act as and enhanced software engineer, simply describe what is software engineering to a five year old using illustrations and emojis.
